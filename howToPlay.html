        <h2 style="color: #ff0000">HOW TO PLAY:</h2>
        <h3 style="color: #ff0000">SINGLE PLAYER</h3>
        <p>For SINGLE-PLAYER mode, there are no controls. This version of the game was strictly for demonstrational and testing purposes. We used this to build the original game and test out certain features, such as the AI of the troops and the battle mechanics. As of now, this is purely a simulation of two players fighting, both using the same armies.</p>
        <br>
        <h3 style="color: #ff0000">MULTIPLAYER</h3>
        <span>The MULTIPLAYER mode of the game DOES contain player controls. After connecting to the server, enter in a name and join a room. Once two players are in a room, hit the </span><span style="color:#00ff00">START GAME </span><span>button to begin a match. Both players will see a blank screen. This is the army creation screen. Press </span><span style="color: #00ff00">"Q" for MELEE TROOPS, "W" for ARCHER TROOPS and "E" for TANK TROOPS.</span><span> Once you are finished, hit the </span><span style="color: #00ff00">SUBMIT </span><span>button. If you make a mistake, hit clear. Once both players hit submit, a battle will begin.</span>
